# Countdown Trigger Implementation - Completed

## ✅ Completed Tasks

### 1. Modified Countdown Class
- **File**: test.py
- **Changes**:
  - Added `started` flag to prevent multiple countdown starts
  - Modified `did_mount()` to not start automatically
  - Added `start()` method to manually begin countdown
  - Updated `will_unmount()` to properly handle cleanup

### 2. Added Countdown Reference
- **File**: test.py
- **Changes**:
  - Added `countdown_ref = ft.Ref[Countdown]()` to access countdown instance
  - Updated Countdown instantiation to use `ref=countdown_ref`

### 3. Implemented Cell Selection Logic
- **File**: test.py
- **Changes**:
  - Added logic in `current_question_number()` function
  - Checks if `refdisqnumber_val_ref.current.value == "2"` (cell A2)
  - Calls `countdown_ref.current.start()` when A2 is selected
  - Includes null check to prevent errors

## 🎯 Functionality
- Countdown now starts **only** when cell A2 is selected
- Countdown will not start automatically on app launch
- Countdown can only be started once (prevents multiple starts)
- Maintains all original countdown functionality (heartbeat script, UI updates)

## 🧪 Testing Recommendations
- Launch the application
- Use keyboard controls to navigate to different cells
- Verify countdown starts when selecting cell A2
- Confirm countdown works correctly once started
- Test that countdown doesn't restart if A2 is selected again

## 📝 Notes
- Cell selection is controlled by `refdisqnumber_val_ref.current.value`
- A2 corresponds to value "2" in the cell selector
- Countdown maintains original 100-second duration and heartbeat functionality
